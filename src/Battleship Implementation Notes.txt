Gameplay loop logic:

1. Display menu with options
2. Start game
3. Switch to player 1 empty board
4. Player 1 turn to populate board
5. Switch to player 2 empty board
6. Player 2 turn to populate board
7. Switch to player 1 board
8. Player 1 turn to make guess
9. Switch to player 2 board
10. Player 2 turn to make guess
11. Game ends when one player loses all ships

Each turn displays number of sunk ships for both players
Board spaces will be highlighted with red H or white M when interacted with
____________________________________________________________________________
So far:
- Classes created and populated
- Ships occupy multiple spaces
- Board can be manipulated and shown
- Ships can be created, placed on board, and hit
- Game can be saved (saving and loading not properly tested)
- Game can be started, ships can be placed,
ships can be hit, missed, or sunk (all show except hits)

To do:
!! Incorporate player class with turns, etc.
!! - Create main gameplay loop logic as above
!! - Implement bot as player 2 (bot chooses random board spaces to fire on)
- 3 to quit, 4 to replay during gameplay?
____________________________________________________________________________
B grade requirements:

- 2 players
- Full game logic
- 3 ship types with 3 hit points (3 ships per player)
- Player turn logic
- Colors for hits and misses
- Create bot option for player 2
- Quit and restart during game functionality
- Input validation
- Verbose error handling

OOP Notes:
- Instead of individual player ship arraylists (p1ships), (p1.shiplist)
- Same for player inputs?
